# Library System

Simple, fast, efficient library system implemented in C++

# How to use?

Since I already implemented the entire logic of the program (including the main), you will have to compile main.cpp (via clang, etc.) and just run it. It's a fully working menu.

Only saves locally, no I/O added yet.
